# **PyTorch Historical Assets Document Processing(OCR)**

## Introduction
In the utilities industry, it is common to work processes which are manual, disconnected, or archaic in nature. There has been a significant increase in the amount of documentation over time, and as a result, many systems are unable to handle the large volume of engineering data that has been produced. Teams across the spectrum of maintenance, operations and engineering spend significant effort - searching for accurate engineering information ,read through paper-based engineering documents and maintenance job postings. By providing digitized data-driven insights of the assets, AI-powered Intelligent document processing solutions can minimize service disruptions , reduce operational costs, and extend the useful lifetime by several years (Accruent, [How Utilities Ensure Data Integrity with Document Version Control | Accruent](https://www.accruent.com/resources/blog-posts/how-utilities-ensure-data-integrity-document-version-control), 2023)

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is used to automatically scan document images, identify the regions of interest (ROIs) with text 
and extract the different letters from the ​text detected.

## Purpose
Intelligent document processing requires the processing of structured, semi-structured,  and unstructured content in documents. This requires image preprocessing, analysis, text region detection and text extraction using OCR and 
entities recognition using NLP techniques. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is used to automatically scan document images, identify the 
regions with text and extract the different letters from the ​text detected. As an industry solution, the scanned input document image can be passed through any text detector (like Keras OCR)
and then the extracted ROIs containing texts are sent to the Text Extraction module (CRNN architecture) from which 
the text can be extracted and entities like Date, time, price, address, etc. can be detected as per the specific use case.

## Reference Solution
In this reference kit, we are building a deep learning model to perform text extraction from documents. We also focus on the following critical factors
- Faster model development
- Performance efficient model inference and deployment mechanism.

In a typical deep learning based OCR solution, pretrained text detection model gives good accuracy on detecting text regions in the images but text recognition model is generally finetuned on the given dataset. Accuracy of text recognition model is dependent on the different properties of text like font, font-size, font color and handwritten or printed text etc. Hence it is advised to finetune the text recognition model on given dataset instead of using pretrained model to observe more accuracy in OCR pipeline. For this reference kit, in the end to end ocr pipeline, we are using pretrained text detection model from EasyOCR python library (installation steps can be found in this link https://pypi.org/project/easyocr), to detect the region of interest (ROIs) in the input image. These ROIs are cropped from the input image and passed to the trained text recognition (CRNN) model. We have focused only on training and inference of the text recognition component only.

For text recognition, we use CRNN, a classical convolutional recurrent neural network. CRNN model is the most widely used for text recognition. Tuning parameters have been introduced to the model in an optimization algorithm with different learning rates for checking how quickly the model is adapted to the problem in order to increase the model performance.

Since GPUs are the natural choice for deep learning and AI processing to achieve a higher FPS rate but are very expensive and memory-consuming, the experiment applies model quantization using Intel's technology, which compresses the model using quantization techniques and uses the CPU for processing while maintaining the accuracy and speeding up the inference time of text extraction from documents.

Finally, we highlight the difference between using Intel® OneAPI packages against a stock version of the same packages. The time required for training the model, inference time and the accuracy of model are captured for multiple runs on the stock version as well on the Intel OneAPI version. The average of these runs is considered and the comparison is provided.

### ***Hyperparameter Analysis***

In realistic scenarios, an analyst will run the text extraction model multiple times on the same dataset, scanning across different hyperparameters.  
To capture this, we measure the total amount of time it takes to generate results across different hyperparameters for a fixed algorithm, which we 
define as hyperparameter analysis.  In practice, the results of each hyperparameter analysis provide the analyst with many different models that 
they can take and further analyze.

The below table provides details about the hyperparameters & values used for hyperparameter tuning in our benchmarking experiments:
| **Algorithm**                     | **Hyperparameters**
| :---                              | :---
| CRNN Architecture                 | learning rate, epochs, batch size

 We introduced different learning rates and batch sizes to the model architecture on the dataset, we increased the number of epochs to reach maximum accuracy on the training set. Hyperparameters considered for tuning are `Learning Rate, Epochs, Batch Size`.

## **Optimizing the E2E solution with Intel® Extension for PyTorch**
Although AI delivers a solution to address text extraction, a production scale implementation with millions 
or billions of records demands for more compute power without leaving any performance on the table. Under this scenario, 
text extraction models are essential for identifying and extracting text which will enable analysts to take
appropriate decisions. For example, printed invoices can be used to identifying and extracting text, the results of 
extraction can be later used for multiple purposes. In order to derive the most insightful and beneficial actions to take, 
they will need to study and analyze the data generated through various feature sets and algorithms, thus requiring frequent 
re-runs of the algorithms under many different parameter sets. To utilize all the hardware resources efficiently, Software 
optimizations cannot be ignored.   
 
This reference kit solution extends to demonstrate the advantages of using the Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit on the task of 
building a model for text extractions from documents.  The savings gained from using the Intel® Extension for PyTorch can 
lead an analyst to more efficiently explore and understand data, leading to better and more precise targeted solutions.

### **Optimized software components**
Intel® Extension for PyTorch (version 1.12.100) framework has been optimized using oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) primitives, a popular performance 
library for deep learning applications. It provides accelerated implementations of numerous popular DL algorithms that optimize performance on 
Intel® hardware with only requiring a few simple lines of modifications to existing code.

Intel® Neural Compressor (version 1.14.0) is an open-source Python library. ML developers can incorporate this library for quantizing 
the deep learning models. The quantized models give the advantage of compressing the models and boost in performance for inference time.​

### **Using Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™**
When it comes to the deployment of this model on Edge devices, with less computing and memory resources, we further need to explore 
options for quantizing and compressing the model which brings out the same level of accuracy and efficient utilization of underlying 
computing resources. Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit facilitates the optimization of a deep learning model from a framework 
and deployment using an inference engine on such computing platforms based on Intel hardware accelerators. This section covers the steps 
to use this toolkit for model quantization and measure its performance.

### ***Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Environment Setup***
Follow the below conda installation commands to setup the OpenVINO enviroment along with the necessary packages.
>Note: It is assumed that the present working directory is the root directory of this code repository

```shell
conda env create --file env/openvino_pot/openvino-ocr.yml
```
This command utilizes the dependencies found in the `env/openvino_pot/openvino.yml` file to create an environment as follows:

**YAML file**                                 | **Environment Name** |  **Configuration** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `env/openvino_pot/openvino-ocr.yml`             | `openvino-ocr` | 2022.1.0

Use the following command to activate the environment that was created:
```shell
conda activate openvino-ocr
```

#### Model conversion to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR) conversion
Below script is used to convert FP32 model to ONNX model representation. The converted onnx model file will be saved in 
./src/openvino.

```
  python src/onnx_convert.py -m [FP32ModelPath] -output [output dir path to save the onnx model]
```

Arguments:
```
  -m, --fp32modelpath             FP32 model Path
  -output, --onnxmodelpath        give path in which you want the ONNX model to be stored
```

<b>Example</b>
```sh
python src/onnx_convert.py -m src/crnn_models/CRNN-1010_Intel_WHP_best_900.pth -output src/openvino
```
The converted model will be saved to the src/openvino folder in .onnx format.

Below command is used to convert the onnx model to OpenVINO IR model format.
```sh
mo --input_model <onnx model> --output_dir <output dir path to save the IR model>
```
Arguments
```
--input_model     onnx model
--output_dir      path of the folder to save the OpenVINO IR model format
```
The above command will generate `<model-name>.bin` and `<model-name>.xml` as output which can be used for OpenVINO inference. Default precision is FP32.\
\
<b>Example</b>
```sh
mo --input_model ./src/openvino/test_model.onnx --output_dir ./src/openvino
```

#### Model Performance with OpenVINO Post-Training Optimization Tool
Post-training Optimization Tool (POT) is designed to accelerate the inference of deep learning models by applying special methods without model 
retraining or fine-tuning. One such method is post-training quantization.

Below command is used to run the benchmark tool for the ONNX model generated. 

```sh
benchmark_app -m <path of onnx model>
```

Argument
```
-m,--modelpath   path of model in onnx format
```
<b>Example</b>
```sh
benchmark_app -m ./src/openvino/test_model.onnx
```

Below command is used to run the benchmark tool for the OpenVINO IR model. 
```sh
benchmark_app -m <Path of the OpenVino IR model in xml format>
```
Argument
```
-m,--modelpath   Path of model in OpenVino IR model in xml format
```
<b>Example</b>
```sh
benchmark_app -m ./src/openvino/test_model.xml
```
#### Model Conversion Using OpenVino Quantization
A configuration file is needed to configure the various parameters for post training optimization tool (pot). The same configuration file has already been provided in the repo at follwing path: 
```
src/openvino/OCR_model_int8.json
```

User can update the following parameters in the json file using any editor tool available on the computer.
```
"model_name"    : Name of the output model
"model"         : path to fp32 model (.xml) file
"weights"       : path to fp32 model weights (.bin) file
```
Use the below command to quantize the model. When this command execution completes successfully, it generates a 
folder with the name `results` where the quantized model files will be generated.
```sh
cd src/openvino
pot -c <path of the configuration file> -d 
```
Argument
```
-c,--configfile  path of the POT configuration file
```
<b>Example</b>
```sh
cd src/openvino
pot -c OCR_model_int8.json -d
```
After running the above command, we can verify that "OCR_model.bin", "OCR_model.xml", "OCR_model.mapping" files (quantized model) got generated on "src/openvino/results/optimized" path.
##### Model Performance Using Quantized (INT8) Model
Use the below command to run the benchmark tool for the Quantized OpenVINO IR model.

```sh
benchmark_app -m <quantized POT model in xml format>
```

Argument
```
-m,--quantizedmodelpath   Quantized POT model in xml format
```
<b>Example</b>
```sh
benchmark_app -m ./results/optimized/OCR_model.xml
```

#### **Conclusion**
To build an OCR text extraction solution using CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) transfer learning approach, 
at scale, Data Scientists will need to train models for substantial datasets and run inference more frequently. The ability 
to accelerate training will allow them to train more frequently and achieve better accuracy. Besides training, faster speed 
in inference will allow them to run prediction in real-time scenarios as well as more frequently. A Data Scientist will also 
look at text extraction from documents and categorize them so that it can be better understood and analyzed. This task requires 
a lot of training and retraining, making the job tedious. The ability to get it to faster speed will accelerate the ML pipeline. 
This reference kit implementation provides performance-optimized guide around named OCR text extraction use cases that can be 
easily scaled across similar use cases.
